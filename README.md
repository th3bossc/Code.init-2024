## VITALYZE

### Overview
VITALYZE is a tool designed to take black and white photos as input and provide a colored image as output. It utilizes advanced algorithms to intelligently add color to grayscale images, creating vibrant and realistic results.

### Features
- **Black and White to Color Conversion**: The primary functionality of the engine is to convert black and white images into colorized versions.
- **Adjustable Saturation**, Hue, and Contrast: Users have the option to fine-tune the colorization process by adjusting parameters such as saturation, hue, and contrast. This allows for further customization and enhancement of the generated image.
- **Intuitive Interface**: The engine provides an intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to upload their black and white photos, adjust settings, and download the colorized output.

### Usage
- **Input image**: Drag and drop the image into the selection box or choose a file from the system to generate a coloured version of the desired image
- **Preview and Download**: The image generated can be compared with the original version and be downloaded or the user can access advanced options to edit it if he needs 
- **Adjust settings**: Intuitive slider UI is provided for the user to change the hue, saturation and contrast of the image as well as download the final version
